# Aurora

Aurora is a minimalist, blog-aware static site generator. It only provides the
absolute minimum required to render your Markdown and Jinja templates to a
complete website. Aurora is designed for people who want control over their
content; *your site, your rules.*

## Usage

Install the CLI application with `pip3 install aurora`. Note that only Python 3
is supported.
